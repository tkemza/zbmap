# ZBmap

## Overview

ZBmap is a powerful and versatile IP scanning tool developed by ZeroByte, also known as Zbyte. This script-based utility is designed to facilitate network discovery and security assessments by providing users with a wide range of scanning options to identify live hosts, open ports, services running on those ports, and potential vulnerabilities within a network. Whether you are a network administrator, a security professional, or a penetration tester, ZBmap is an essential tool for performing thorough network reconnaissance.


## Purpose

The primary objective of ZBmap is to streamline the process of scanning IP addresses and ranges. It serves multiple purposes:

+ Network Discovery: Identify devices connected to a network, along with their IP addresses and open ports.
+ Service Enumeration: Determine the services and versions running on identified ports, aiding in identifying potential security risks.
+ Vulnerability Assessment: Utilize scripts to check for known vulnerabilities in services running on target hosts.
+ Performance Monitoring: Conduct periodic scans to track changes in network configurations or to monitor uptime.
## Features

**Extensive Scanning Options:**

ZBmap offers a comprehensive set of scanning options ranging from simple pings to complex service version detections. Users can choose the desired level of detail and specificity for their scans.

**Support for Various Protocols:**

The tool supports both TCP and UDP scans, allowing users to evaluate all aspects of their network.

**Customizable Scans:**

Users can perform targeted scans by specifying particular ports, using script scans for detailed service analysis, or conducting comprehensive scans across all ports.

**User-Friendly Interface:**

The interactive menu allows users to select scanning options easily, making it accessible even for those with limited command-line experience.
Export Capabilities:

ZBmap can export scan results in XML and web XML formats, facilitating further analysis or reporting.

**Vulnerability Scanning:**

By leveraging Nmap's scripting capabilities, ZBmap can check for vulnerabilities on the target hosts, helping users to secure their networks effectively.

**Verbose Output:**

The tool provides verbose and increased verbose options, giving users detailed information about the scanning process and results.

**Range Scanning:**

ZBmap allows scanning across a specified range of IP addresses, making it suitable for large networks.

**Periodic Statistics:**

Users can view statistics every 30 seconds during scans, offering real-time insight into the scanning process.
Functionality
When executed, ZBmap presents the user with a menu of scanning options. Each option corresponds to a specific type of scan or function, allowing for targeted reconnaissance:

+ Simple Scan: Quickly checks for live hosts on the network.
+ Verbose Mode: Provides detailed output during scans.
+ TCP and UDP Scans: Evaluates open ports and services for both TCP and UDP protocols.
+ Service and OS Detection: Identifies the services running on open ports and attempts to determine the operating systems of the scanned hosts.
+ Scripting Capabilities: Users can specify custom scripts to be executed against the target, enabling tailored assessments.
+ Usage Scenarios

**Network Administration:**

Administrators can use ZBmap to quickly identify devices on their network, monitor for unauthorized devices, and ensure that services are running as expected.

**Security Audits:**

Security professionals can employ ZBmap during vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses in network configurations and service exposures.

**Penetration Testing:**

Penetration testers can utilize ZBmap as part of their reconnaissance phase to gather information about targets and identify potential attack vectors.

**Educational Purposes:**

Students and learners can use ZBmap to understand networking concepts, practice network scanning techniques, and learn about vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.
Technical Specifications
+ Dependencies: ZBmap relies on Nmap, a widely used network scanning tool, for performing the actual scans. Users must have Nmap installed on their systems for ZBmap to function correctly.

+ Supported Platforms: ZBmap is a shell script and can run on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS. It may also work in environments like Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

+ Command-Line Interface: The script is designed for command-line usage, with input prompts for various parameters, ensuring a straightforward interaction model.

+ Color-Coded Output: The script employs ANSI escape codes for color-coded terminal output, enhancing readability and user experience.

**Getting Started**

**To use ZBmap, follow these steps:**

**Installation:**

Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.
Ensure that Nmap is installed. You can install Nmap using your package manager (e.g., apt install nmap for Ubuntu).

**Permissions:**

Make the script executable by running: **chmod +x zbmap.sh.**

**Execution:**

Run the script in your terminal: **./zbmap.sh.**

Follow the on-screen prompts to select scanning options and enter target IP addresses.
Conclusion

ZBmap is an invaluable tool for anyone involved in network management and security. Its extensive features, coupled with a user-friendly interface, make it a preferred choice for performing IP scans and discovering potential vulnerabilities. By integrating ZBmap into your toolkit, you can enhance your network's security posture and ensure robust monitoring of connected devices.
